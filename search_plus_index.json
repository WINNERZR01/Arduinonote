It mainly show you some arduino skills,which was learned through studying. Welcome to star and fork. My hexo blog is Winnerzr. My github link Winnerzr. It is a book powered by GitBook. The software used in the experiment is Arduino Your support is the driving force of my creation. © by Winnerzr all right reserved，powered by Gitbook该文档修订时间： 2020-11-04 21:20:47 "},"hacker.html":{"url":"hacker.html","title":"Hacker","keywords":"","body":"© by Winnerzr all right reserved，powered by Gitbook该文档修订时间： 2020-11-04 21:20:47 "},"闲置电脑电源改装.html":{"url":"闲置电脑电源改装.html","title":"闲置电脑电源改装","keywords":"","body":"DIY - Lab Bench Power SupplyV 1.0 PowerDIY - Lab Bench Power Supply Internet Images： Knowledge： 5V：受主板控制，当电源工作时有输出，当电源停止工作时停止输出。 5VSB：一直接通的电源，当电源接上市电后便有这个5V输出。 首先，电源通电后，就一直有+5VSB电源输出了，而主+5V电源必须在电脑开机或被唤醒状态下，才有输出。其次，由于唤醒器件耗电小，+5VSB最大提供的电流相比主+5V就小很多。再次，系统关机后，主+5V电源被关掉，而+5VSB依然存在（除非切断了外接电源）。 V 1.0 Power Material： GreatWall Power： These are the components I'm using: dc panel voltmeter/ammeter (0-100V & 0-10A) rotary switch with 12 positions + switch knob double rocker switch (or 2 simple rocker switches) 3 red binding posts 3 black binding posts USB port 10W 43 Ohm resistor one LED 470 ohm resistor (for the LED) shrinking tubes (2 - 10mm) 接法：细红线和黄线接正极，细黑线不接，粗黑线接电源负极，粗红线接负载负极 © by Winnerzr all right reserved，powered by Gitbook该文档修订时间： 2020-11-13 22:19:02 "}}
